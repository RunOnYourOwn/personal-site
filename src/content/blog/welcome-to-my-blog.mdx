# Welcome to My Blog: A Journey in Data Science and Infrastructure

Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Aaron Brazier, a Senior Data Scientist at BP with a passion for turning complex data into actionable insights and building robust infrastructure that scales. This blog represents my journey at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and modern infrastructure.

## Who I Am

As a Senior Data Scientist specializing in oil & gas analytics, I've spent years developing and deploying machine learning solutions that enhance operational efficiency and reduce downtime. My work spans the full data science lifecycle‚Äîfrom stakeholder engagement and requirements gathering to model deployment, monitoring, and mentoring junior team members.

What sets me apart is my **full-stack approach** to data science. I'm not just focused on the statistical modeling side, but deeply involved in the entire pipeline from data cleaning and evaluation to cloud deployment and stakeholder communication. This comprehensive perspective allows me to bridge the gap between technical complexity and business value.

## My Technical Journey

### Data Science & Machine Learning

My expertise centers around **time series analysis** and **anomaly detection** in industrial settings. I've developed patent-pending methodologies for identifying operational issues before they impact production, representing a novel approach to industrial machine learning.

**Key Technologies:**

- **Python ecosystem**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Cloud platforms**: Microsoft Azure for scalable ML deployments
- **Specialized domains**: Time series forecasting, anomaly detection, feature engineering

### Homelab Infrastructure

Beyond my professional work, I maintain a **production-grade homelab** that showcases my infrastructure expertise:

- **3-Node Proxmox Cluster**: Two Minisforum MS-01s and a custom EPYC 7502P server
- **250TB Storage**: TrueNAS, Unraid, and ZFS with 3-2-1 backup strategy
- **Automation Pipeline**: Gitea, Renovate, Discord bots, and Portainer orchestration
- **Home Automation**: Home Assistant, ZigBee, MQTT, and Z-Wave integration

This infrastructure serves as my local AI processing hub and development environment, mirroring professional DevOps workflows with automated CI/CD pipelines.

## What You'll Find Here

## My Vision

I believe in the power of **practical innovation**‚Äîtaking cutting-edge research and making it work in real-world scenarios. My goal is to share knowledge that helps others build better systems, whether that's a machine learning model that prevents equipment failure or a homelab setup that rivals enterprise infrastructure.

The future of data science lies in **full-stack practitioners** who understand both the mathematical foundations and the engineering challenges of production systems. Through this blog, I hope to contribute to that evolution.
