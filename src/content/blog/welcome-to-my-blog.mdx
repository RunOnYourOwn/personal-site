# Welcome to My Blog: A Journey in Data Science and Infrastructure

Hey there! Welcome to my blog. I'm Aaron.

I work as a Senior Data Scientist at BP, where I spend my days turning messy data into insights that actually matter. But what really gets me excited is building things—whether that's a machine learning model that prevents equipment failures or a homelab setup.

## My Story

I've been in the data science world for a while now, and I've learned that the best solutions come from understanding the whole picture. That's why I take a **full-stack approach** to data science. I'm not just building models in isolation—I'm involved from the very beginning when we're figuring out what problems we need to solve, all the way through to deploying those solutions and making sure they keep working.

What I love most is working with time series data and finding patterns that others miss. I've even developed some patent-pending methods for spotting operational issues before they become real problems. It's pretty cool when you can predict something's going to break before it actually does.

## The Tech Side

### Data Science & Machine Learning

My bread and butter is **time series analysis** and **anomaly detection**. There's something satisfying about taking a stream of sensor data and teaching a computer to spot when something's not quite right.

**The tools I use:**

- **Python** - PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Azure** - For getting models into production
- **Time series stuff** - Forecasting, anomaly detection, feature engineering

### My Homelab

When I'm not working, I'm usually tinkering with my homelab. It's become this massive project that's taught me more about infrastructure than I ever learned in a classroom.

**What I'm running:**

- **3-Node Proxmox Cluster** - Two Minisforum MS-01s and a custom EPYC server
- **250TB of Storage** - TrueNAS, Unraid, and ZFS with proper backups
- **Full Automation** - Gitea, Renovate, Discord bots, and Portainer
- **Home Automation** - Home Assistant managing everything from lights to security

It's basically my own private cloud, and it's where I experiment with new technologies and run my personal projects.

## What You'll Find Here

I'm planning to write about the stuff that actually matters to people building real systems:

### Data Science That Works

- How to build models that actually get deployed
- Lessons learned from industrial applications
- The messy reality of working with real-world data
- What I wish I knew when I was starting out

### Homelab Adventures

- Building infrastructure on a budget
- Automation that actually saves time
- Hardware reviews and what's worth the money
- Self-hosting solutions for privacy and control

### Technology Insights

- Tools that make my life easier
- Performance optimization tricks
- Open-source projects I'm excited about
- Trends worth paying attention to

### Career Stuff

- What I've learned from mentoring others
- Building technical teams that work
- Balancing technical depth with business impact
- Industry insights from oil & gas

## Why I'm Writing This

I believe the best solutions come from people who understand both the technical details and the bigger picture. The future belongs to practitioners who can build models AND deploy them, who understand the math AND the engineering challenges.

My goal is to share the kind of knowledge that helps you build better systems. Whether that's a machine learning model that prevents downtime or a homelab setup that gives you complete control over your data, I want to help you get there.

## Let's Connect

I'm always up for a good conversation about data science, infrastructure, or just building cool stuff. If you're working on similar problems or just curious about this intersection of data science and infrastructure, I'd love to hear from you.

- **Email**: aaronbrazier@gmail.com

## What's Coming Up

I've got some exciting posts planned:

- How I built a production-grade homelab without breaking the bank
- Real lessons from deploying ML models in industrial environments
- Automation strategies that actually save time (not just look cool)
- Hardware reviews and what's actually worth buying

Thanks for joining me on this journey. I'm excited to share what I've learned and learn from all of you along the way.
