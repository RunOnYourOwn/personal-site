## Coming Soon

Detailed documentation of my production-grade homelab infrastructure is coming soon. This will include:

- **3-Node Proxmox Cluster**: Two Minisforum MS-01s and custom EPYC 7502P server
- **250TB Storage**: TrueNAS, Unraid, and ZFS with 3-2-1 backup strategy
- **Automation Pipeline**: Gitea, Renovate, Discord bots, and Portainer orchestration
- **Home Automation**: Home Assistant, ZigBee, MQTT, and Z-Wave integration
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards and comprehensive infrastructure monitoring

This infrastructure serves as my local AI processing hub and development environment, mirroring professional DevOps workflows with automated CI/CD pipelines.
